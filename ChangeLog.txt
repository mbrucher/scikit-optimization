0.18 to 0.19:
 * Some changes for NLP/NSP solver ralg (especially related to handling linear constraints Ax <= b, Aeq x = beq, lb <= x <= ub)
 * Bugfix for ralg IPOPT linear constraints handling
 * ALGENCAN v 2.0.x has been connected (v 1.0 is no longer supported, v 2.0.3 or later is required)
 * bugfix for constrained NLSP graphic output (constrained nssolve isn't turned to latest ralg version yet)
 * scale parameter for lpSolve (p.scale = {False} | True | 0 | 1)
 * New OO class LLAVP (linear least absolute values aka linear least deviations)
 * Improved handling of non-linear functions with restricted dom
 * GLP (global) solver galileo now can handle integer problems (via p.useInteger = 1 or True)
 * Another one GLP solver connected: pswarm
 * Lots of work related to oofun concept (see OO Doc page for details)
 * Add converters llsp2nlp, llavp2nsp
 * Convenient handling of maximization problems (via p.goal = 'max' or 'maximum')
 * Some code clean up and bugfixes
Backward incompatibility:
 * Changed objective function in LLSP
 * MATLAB-style gradtol renamed to gtol (for to provide same syntax to scipy.optimize fmin_bfgs, fmin_cg and less-to-type)

0.17 to 0.18:
* connection to glpk MILP solver (requires cvxopt v >= 1.0)
* connection to NLP solver IPOPT (requires pyipopt installation, that is currently available for Linux only)
* major changes for ralg
* splitting non-linear constraints can benefit for some solvers
* unified text output for NLP solvers
* handling of  maximization problems (via p.goal = 'max' or 'maximum')
* some bugfixes, lots of code cleanup

0.15 to 0.17:
* new classes: GLP (global problem), MMP (mini-max problem)
* several new solvers written: goldenSection, nsmm
* some more solvers connected: scipy_slsqp, bvls, galileo
* possibility to change default solver parameters
* user-defined callback functions
* changes in auto derivatives check
* "noise" parameter for noisy functions
* some changes to NLP/NSP solver ralg
* some changes in graphical output: initial estimations xlim, ylim
* scaling
* some bugfixes
